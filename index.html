      Like Tears in Rain

        I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams
        glitter
        in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... Time to die.

      <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just
        his
        life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
